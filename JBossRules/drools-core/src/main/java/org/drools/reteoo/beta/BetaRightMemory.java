/**
 * BetaRightMemory
 * 
 * The <code>BetaRightMemory</code> is the interface for all classes
 * implementing the right memory of a <code>BetaMemory</code> instance. 
 * 
 * The right memory is responsible for indexing and storing references
 * to all input fact handles in the ReteOO network.
 * 
 * Specialized implementations for this interface are capable of indexing 
 * and partitioning the fact handles with the objective of improve query time.
 * Although, the implementations are all required to keep the order of
 * objects, and iterate then in order with the <code>iterator()</code> method.
