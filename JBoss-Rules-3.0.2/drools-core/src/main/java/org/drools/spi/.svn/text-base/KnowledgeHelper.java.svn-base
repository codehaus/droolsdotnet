 * KnowledgeHelper implementation types are injected into consequenses

 * Of particular interest is the modifyObject method as it allows an object to
 * be modified without having to specify the facthandle, because they are not
 * passed to the consequence at runtime. To achieve this the implementation will
 * need to lookup the fact handle of the object form the WorkingMemory.
