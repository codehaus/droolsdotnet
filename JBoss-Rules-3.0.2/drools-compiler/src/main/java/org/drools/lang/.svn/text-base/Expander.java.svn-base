/**
 * Expanders are extension points for expanding 
 * expressions in DRL at parse time.
 * This is just-in-time translation, or macro expansion, or
 * whatever you want.
 * 
 * The important thing is that it happens at the last possible moment, 
 * so any errors in expansion are included in the parsers errors.
 * 
 * Just-in-time expansions may include complex pre-compilers, 
 * or just macros, and everything in between.
 * 
 * Expanders should ideally not make presumptions on any embedded semantic 
 * language. For instance, java aware pre processing should be done in
 * drools-java semantic module, not in the parser itself. Expanders should 
 * be reusable across semantic languages.
